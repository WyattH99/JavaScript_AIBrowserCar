This project was a course from Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor on freeCodeCamp.org

The goal of this was to learn more about Neural Networks by building one from Vanilla JS. 

I learned:
    - How to build a Vanilla JS browser game
    - Detecting User Input, Car Sensors, Traffic, Parallelization, and Collisions
    - Building Neural Networks from Neuron, to Layers, to Networks
    - Using Weights and Biases, Feed Forward, and a simple manual Genetic Algorithm

I've never built a browser game like this before and was very pleased with the outcome.

If you want to run it just download the code and navigate to "index.html" using the path in a browser.
Like this -> "/Users/wyatt/Desktop/JavaScript_AIBrowserCar/index.html"
